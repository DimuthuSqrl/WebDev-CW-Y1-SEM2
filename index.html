                <p>Overwatch has currently been in an interesting state with the meta
                    seemingly being more focused on playing at range than before. That said heroes like Widowmaker are
                    still not having a fun time due to the shields of Sigma keeping her at bay. This season has also had
                    the Lunar New Year event Bounty Hunter added to it and that has been a fun addition. With
                    Blizzconline hopefully having some information about Overwatch 2 and what fans can expect for the
                    current Overwatch, it will be interesting to see what comes with the start of Competitive Season 27
                </p>

                <p>The Overwatch League™ is an international esports league comprising 20 city-based teams and featuring
                    the best Overwatch® players in the world. The 2021 season begins on April 16 and concludes with the
                    playoffs and Grand Finals in September. Showcasing top-tier Overwatch competition, thrilling
                    storylines, an eye-popping prize pool, robust viewership rewards, and cutting-edge production value,
                    the Overwatch League is the world's premier esports league

                    Regular-season play will be structured in four tournament cycles: the May Melee, June Joust, Summer
                    Showdown, and Countdown Cup. Teams will play four qualifier matches each cycle to determine seeding
                    for each of the culminating tournaments.

                    Teams will be divided into two groups based on their location this season: East and West. The East
                    will consist of 8 teams, with the remaining 12 in the West. Regular-season qualifier matches and
                    tournament qualification will be based on competition within each group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Qualification for in-season tournaments and for the 2021 playoffs will be based on each team’s total
                    League Points. There are two ways teams can earn League Points: winning qualifier matches and
                    placing well in tournaments. Teams get 1 League Point for each match win during regular-season
                    qualification matches. During tournaments, there’s additional points at stake:

                    <li>1st place = 3 points</li>

                    The coronavirus pandemic put a halt to Riot Games hosting a multi-city tournament last year,
                    however, the publisher aims to do so for 2021’s iteration of Worlds. More host cities will be
                    announced throughout the course of the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John Needham, Global Head of Esports at Riot Games, spoke on the news: “After a year full of
                    unexpected challenges, amazing competition, and major milestones for our sport, we’re looking
                    forward to a season that should be even more thrilling. It’s only fitting that we return to China,
                    home to our biggest league and tens of millions of longtime fans, to produce the world’s
                    highest-calibre esports event in one of China’s most innovative cities.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside announcing its first host city for the 2021 World Championship, the publisher has unveiled
                    initial details surrounding its League of Legends: Wild Rift esports structure.

                <p>
                    Needham also spoke on creating a Wild Rift esports circuit: “While we continue to oversee a rollout
                    of Wild Rift via Open Beta in numerous countries, we’re ready to establish a framework for players
                    to compete at the highest level. This will be the year we will experiment and learn, setting the
                    foundations for the long-term success of the sport. You will see our first competitions come to life
                    later in 2021.”</p>
                <p>
                    The update follows on from Riot Games Southeast Asia already unveiling its competitive plans for the
                    mobile game within Malaysia and Thailand. Tournaments, which will be hosted by ESL, are expected to
                    take
                    place in the regions sometime this year.

                    The Road Safety World Series is a Twenty20 competition featuring retired cricketers, created by The
                    Road Safety Cell of Maharashtra. Players and teams are stylized as "legends" of their respective
                    countries.

                <p>
                    The Road Safety World series was approved by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[5]
                    The first edition of the tournament begun in March 2020, with the tournament set to take place
                    across venues in Mumbai, and Pune. Sachin Tendulkar (India Legends), Brian Lara (West Indies
                    Legends) Tillakaratne Dilshan (Sri Lanka Legends), Brett Lee (Australia Legends) and Jonty Rhodes
                    (South Africa Legends) were the captains of their respective teams.[6] The tournament was to be
                    played in a round-robin format with the top two finishers playing the final.[7]
                </p>

                <p>
                    On 13 March 2020, as a result of Government Advisory following the global coronavirus pandemic, the
                    remaining seven matches were rescheduled to a later date.[8] It was earlier decided that the
                    remaining seven matches of the tournament would be played behind the closed doors in DY Patil
                    Stadium.[9]
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to Cricschedule, the series will now be starting on 5th March 2021 and will last till 21st
                    March 2021
                </p>

                <p>
                    The organizers, instead of starting afresh in 2021, have opted to resume the previous edition, which
                    was paused after only four games. Four teams – India Legends, Sri Lanka Legends, South Africa
                    Legends, and West Indies Legends – will resume action in 2021, whereas England Legends and
                    Bangladesh Legends will replace -led Australia Legends, who are set to miss due to their inability
                    to travel to India owing to the strict COVID-19 restrictions in Australia.

                <h2>Chris Gayle returns to West Indies squad</h2>
                <img src="images/home/Chris_Gayle,_2010_(1).jpg" alt="lol-league" class="first-img">

                <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
                    Chris Gayle is targeting a third T20 world title as he returns to West Indies colours for the first
                    time
                    since the 2019 World Cup, and says that he is willing to fulfil whatever role is asked of him in the
                    team's bid to retain the trophy in India this year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gayle, 41, has only ever opened the batting in T20I cricket and had almost exclusively batted at the
                    top
                    of the order in his franchise career before the start of the 2020 IPL. But after starting the
                    tournament
                    out of the Kings XI Punjab side, he hit 395 runs in nine innings at No. 3 for the franchise,
                    averaging
                    43.88 and striking at 144.16.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a press conference in Antigua on Monday, two days before the series opener against Sri Lanka,
                    Gayle
                    said that he was happy to bat wherever Kieron Pollard and Phil Simmons asked him to, saying that he
                    would be "the best in the world" regardless of where he came in. He is one of four openers in the
                    14-man
                    squad, along with Evin Lewis, Lendl Simmons and Andre Fletcher.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "It seems like I'm the No. 3 specialist now," he joked. "It was a role that the coach, Anil Kumble,
                    asked me to play. He did mention it before the IPL actually started, which I had no problem with and
                    then eventually, when I actually got the chance, they wanted my experience at No. 3 because Mayank
                    [Agarwal] and KL Rahul were going great guns at the time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "It's not a problem. I'm good at playing spin, I'm as good at playing fast bowlers as anyone as I'm
                    an
                    opener. But with West Indies cricket, whatever role they want me to play, I'm willing to play that
                    particular role. We haven't fully discussed it but I'll get a bit of a heads up and work out what to
                    look forward to in this particular series and down into the World Cup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "If it's opening, I'm ready, No. 3, No. 5 - I'm pretty much flexible. I will still be the best No. 5
                    in
                    the world, best No. 3 in the world."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gayle admitted that he had considered walking away from the game, and that he had planned to focus
                    his
                    efforts on the franchise circuit as he heads into the twilight of his career, but that he found it
                    impossible to turn down a West Indies call-up because "that's where my heart is".
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I thought about actually walking away from the game and then people said: 'No, don't do it, don't
                    do
                    it. Stay and play as long as possible.' So I decided I'm actually going to continue playing. I
                    wasn't
                    actually thinking down this road. I was like, I'm going to play franchise cricket, entertaining
                    people
                    as much as possible, and whatever is left to offer within the game from Chris Gayle, I want to
                    exploit
                    around the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "When I got the call and they asked if I'm willing and interested, I said: 'Yes, I want to play for
                    West
                    Indies'. That's where my heart is. I'm never going to turn down anything pertaining to West Indies
                    cricket at this particular time. So I came back from Pakistan to be a part of the set-up leading
                    into
                    the World Cup so we can have a unity within the group, and then hopefully we can win this T20
                    trophy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "At 41, that's what actually gets me through on a daily basis: it's more mental than physical to me.
                    It's the willpower of the mind. The mind still wants to be out there and be out there on the park,
                    still
                    executing from a batting point of view and still having fun. That's what gives me that extra drive
                    to
                    continue playing. If the mind stops operating like that for me, then I'd have to ask myself a big
                    question there, but for now, it's the mindset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "The mindset is still good. I'm still looking after myself, I still do my training. Most people say
                    'are
                    you on a diet?' I still eat properly, I still eat what I want, I still have my fun. I make sure I
                    have a
                    clear mind at all times. Once you have a clear mind you can be free to do whatever you want."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gayle said that while his short-term ambition was to win this month's three-match series against Sri
                    Lanka, the "bigger picture" was all about defending West Indies' world title. Gayle is one of eight
                    men
                    who won both the 2012 and 2016 finals, and said that he hoped his return would not distract from the
                    team's long-term preparations for the tournament.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I know being back, it might be a little bit of attention, but I don't want it to go in that regards
                    to
                    be honest with you," Gayle said. "We're looking at things as a team point of view. Pollard is a very
                    strong captain [and] we have a lot of very, very good-quality players within the team. I want to win
                    the
                    series. I want to get off to a good start. It's really good to be back. Hopefully I can perform,
                    help
                    the team, and put the team in a winning position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I want to accomplish, starting off by winning the series, but the bigger picture is actually to get
                    three T20 titles under my belt. That's actually the goal I'm setting in my head by winning the T20
                    World
                    Cup. We have quite a few series coming up and we have a lot of cricket leading up to that. We'll try
                    and
                    take as much as possible out of these series coming up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "The World Cup is still a long way off but by the time you quint [blink] it's World Cup time. So we
                    have
                    to try and keep the energy, keep fit, be ready and show the region what we are capable of with these
                    particular guys."
