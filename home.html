                <p style="padding-top: 30px;">Overwatch has currently been in an interesting state with the meta
                    seemingly being more focused on playing at range than before. That said heroes like Widowmaker are
                    still not having a fun time due to the shields of Sigma keeping her at bay. This season has also had
                    the Lunar New Year event Bounty Hunter added to it and that has been a fun addition. With
                    Blizzconline hopefully having some information about Overwatch 2 and what fans can expect for the
                    current Overwatch, it will be interesting to see what comes with the start of Competitive Season 27
                </p>

                    Regular-season play will be structured in four tournament cycles: the May Melee, June Joust, Summer
                    Showdown, and Countdown Cup. Teams will play four qualifier matches each cycle to determine seeding
                    for each of the culminating tournaments.

                    Teams will be divided into two groups based on their location this season: East and West. The East
                    will consist of 8 teams, with the remaining 12 in the West. Regular-season qualifier matches and
                    tournament qualification will be based on competition within each group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Qualification for in-season tournaments and for the 2021 playoffs will be based on each team’s total
                    League Points. There are two ways teams can earn League Points: winning qualifier matches and
                    placing well in tournaments. Teams get 1 League Point for each match win during regular-season
                    qualification matches. During tournaments, there’s additional points at stake:

                    <li>1st place = 3 points</li>
                    <li>2nd place = 2 points</li>
                    <li>3rd place = 1 point</li>

                    The coronavirus pandemic put a halt to Riot Games hosting a multi-city tournament last year,
                    however, the publisher aims to do so for 2021’s iteration of Worlds. More host cities will be
                    announced throughout the course of the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John Needham, Global Head of Esports at Riot Games, spoke on the news: “After a year full of
                    unexpected challenges, amazing competition, and major milestones for our sport, we’re looking
                    forward to a season that should be even more thrilling. It’s only fitting that we return to China,
                    home to our biggest league and tens of millions of longtime fans, to produce the world’s
                    highest-calibre esports event in one of China’s most innovative cities.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside announcing its first host city for the 2021 World Championship, the publisher has unveiled
                    initial details surrounding its League of Legends: Wild Rift esports structure.

                <p>
                    Needham also spoke on creating a Wild Rift esports circuit: “While we continue to oversee a rollout
                    of Wild Rift via Open Beta in numerous countries, we’re ready to establish a framework for players
                    to compete at the highest level. This will be the year we will experiment and learn, setting the
                    foundations for the long-term success of the sport. You will see our first competitions come to life
                    later in 2021.”</p>
                <p>
                    The update follows on from Riot Games Southeast Asia already unveiling its competitive plans for the
                    mobile game within Malaysia and Thailand. Tournaments, which will be hosted by ESL, are expected to
                    take
                    place in the regions sometime this year.

                    The Road Safety World Series is a Twenty20 competition featuring retired cricketers, created by The
                    Road Safety Cell of Maharashtra. Players and teams are stylized as "legends" of their respective
                    countries.

                <p>
                    The Road Safety World series was approved by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[5]
                    The first edition of the tournament begun in March 2020, with the tournament set to take place
                    across venues in Mumbai, and Pune. Sachin Tendulkar (India Legends), Brian Lara (West Indies
                    Legends) Tillakaratne Dilshan (Sri Lanka Legends), Brett Lee (Australia Legends) and Jonty Rhodes
                    (South Africa Legends) were the captains of their respective teams.[6] The tournament was to be
                    played in a round-robin format with the top two finishers playing the final.[7]
                </p>

                <p>
                    On 13 March 2020, as a result of Government Advisory following the global coronavirus pandemic, the
                    remaining seven matches were rescheduled to a later date.[8] It was earlier decided that the
                    remaining seven matches of the tournament would be played behind the closed doors in DY Patil
                    Stadium.[9]
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to Cricschedule, the series will now be starting on 5th March 2021 and will last till 21st
                    March 2021
                </p>

                <p>
                    The organizers, instead of starting afresh in 2021, have opted to resume the previous edition, which
                    was paused after only four games. Four teams – India Legends, Sri Lanka Legends, South Africa
                    Legends, and West Indies Legends – will resume action in 2021, whereas England Legends and
                    Bangladesh Legends will replace -led Australia Legends, who are set to miss due to their inability
                    to travel to India owing to the strict COVID-19 restrictions in Australia.
