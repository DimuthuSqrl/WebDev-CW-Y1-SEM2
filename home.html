                <p style="padding-top: 30px;">Overwatch has currently been in an interesting state with the meta
                    seemingly being more focused on playing at range than before. That said heroes like Widowmaker are
                    still not having a fun time due to the shields of Sigma keeping her at bay. This season has also had
                    the Lunar New Year event Bounty Hunter added to it and that has been a fun addition. With
                    Blizzconline hopefully having some information about Overwatch 2 and what fans can expect for the
                    current Overwatch, it will be interesting to see what comes with the start of Competitive Season 27
                </p>

                    Regular-season play will be structured in four tournament cycles: the May Melee, June Joust, Summer
                    Showdown, and Countdown Cup. Teams will play four qualifier matches each cycle to determine seeding
                    for each of the culminating tournaments.

                    Teams will be divided into two groups based on their location   this season: East and West. The East
                    will consist of 8 teams, with the remaining 12 in the West. Regular-season qualifier matches and
                    tournament qualification will be based on competition within each group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Qualification for in-season tournaments and for the 2021 playoffs will be based on each team’s total League Points. There are two ways teams can earn League Points: winning qualifier matches and placing well in tournaments. Teams get 1 League Point for each match win during regular-season qualification matches. During tournaments, there’s additional points at stake:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st place = 3 points</li>
                        <li>2nd place = 2 points</li>
                        <li>3rd place = 1 point</li>
                    </ul>

                    The coronavirus pandemic put a halt to Riot Games hosting a multi-city tournament last year, however, the publisher aims to do so for 2021’s iteration of Worlds. More host cities will be announced throughout the course of the year.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    John Needham, Global Head of Esports at Riot Games, spoke on the news: “After a year full of unexpected challenges, amazing competition, and major milestones for our sport, we’re looking forward to a season that should be even more thrilling. It’s only fitting that we return to China, home to our biggest league and tens of millions of longtime fans, to produce the world’s highest-calibre esports event in one of China’s most innovative cities.”
